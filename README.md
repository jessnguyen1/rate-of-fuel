Goal of this software: 
A partner of our company has requested to build a software application that will predict the rate of the fuel based on the following criteria:
- Client Location (in-state or out-of-state)
- Client history (existing customer with previous purchase or new)
- Gallons requested
- Company profit margin (%)

Software will include following components:
- Login (Allow Client to register if not a client yet)
- Client Registration (Initially only username and Password)
- Client Profile Management (after client registers they should login first to complete profile)
- Fuel Quote Form with Pricing module (Once user enters all required information pricing module calculates the rate provides total cost)
- Fuel Quote History
